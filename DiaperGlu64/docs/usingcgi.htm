**************************************
* Apache Installation Instructions   *
*  for Mac OS X using a shebang line *
*  last checked: April 16, 2020      *
*  for Mac Os Catalina v10.15.4      *
**************************************

After building diaperglu,

  copy the new diaperglu to the cgi-bin directory of your website.

On my Mac this is at /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables

If you have an older Mac, you should be able to browse to
 http://localhost/cgi-bin/diaperglu
and see the no script file found page.

On Mac Os Catalina, you may need to edit the Apache configuration file.

 The Apache configuration file is called httpd.conf and is located in /etc/Apache2/
 You can't just open this directory in Finder. If you want to use Finder, open
 Finder then do this: Finder -> Go -> Go to folder... then type /etc/Apache2 into
  the popup.
 Once there, I would make a backup copy of httpd.conf just in case you mess it up.
 In order to enable cgi, you need to uncomment two lines. They look like this:
  #LoadModule cgid_module libexec/apache2/mod_cgid.so
  #LoadModule cgi_module libexec/apache2/mod_cgi.so
 You need to remove the beginning # so they look like this:
  LoadModule cgid_module libexec/apache2/mod_cgid.so
  LoadModule cgi_module libexec/apache2/mod_cgi.so

 
 In any case, now you need to start Apache. It doesn't start by itself by default
  anymore so you need to enter this command:
   sudo apachectl start
  
 Now you should be able to browse to http://localhost/cgi-bin/diaperglu
  and see the no script file found page.
  
  
On older versions of Mac OS you may need to enable sharing and/or change the
 permissions on the diaperglu file.

 To enable sharing do this:
  Apple Icon -&gt; System Preferences... -&gt; put a check in the Web Sharing box.
  
 To enable execute permissions for diaperglu do this:
  open a terminal
  change to the /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables directory
  and do chmod +x diaperglu 
  (this give execute permissions to everyone,
   you may just want to give permissions to you and group)


Now make a file helloworld.dglu and save it to the 
 /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables folder with this in it:

#! diaperglu
." CONTENT-TYPE: text/html" CRLF
CRLF
." &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello Apache on Mac OS X&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;" CRLF

Note:
 You need a space after #! and #! must be the first thing on the first line of the
  file. If you cut and paste this example from the browser you may get ctl-m at the
  end of each line which causes problems for Mac Os X.
 If you type this example in using TextEdit, it should be ok except that TextEdit
  will append a .txt to your filename which may not show up in Finder unless you
  uncheck the please add .txt to my filename box.
 It seems for Apache on Monterey, the CONTENT-TYPE line must be immediately after
  the #! line.

 You may need to change the permissions of the helloworld.dglu to execute.
 (I didn't need to do this on Catalina.)
  open a terminal
  change to the /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables directory
  and do chmod +x helloworld.dglu 
  (this give execute permissions to everyone,
   you may just want to give permissions to you and group)

At this point you should be able to browse to

  http://localhost/cgi-bin/diaperglu?helloworld.dglu
  
This should show a 'Hello Apache on Mac OS X' page.

You should also be able to browse to this:

  http://localhost/cgi-bin/helloworld.dglu
  
If you see the message diaperglu^M bad interpreter message with the
 /cgi-bin/helloworld.dglu way of running it, that means your script file has
the control m characters at the end of the lines.

**************************************
* IIS Installation Instructions      *
*  for Windows 10                    *
*  last checked: October 3, 2020     *
**************************************

The default web server directory for IIS is C:\inetpub\wwwroot\
  These instructions are for the default server directory.

First you need to make sure IIS is installed and CGI and/or ISAPI is enabled.

To do this, go to:
  Start -> Windows System -> Control Panel -> Programs -> Turn Windows Features On and Off

Then make sure the Internet Information Services box has the black square in it.
  Then make sure the cgi and/or isapi boxes have the black square in them.
  The cgi and isapi boxes can be found at this position in the heirarchical list:

  Internet Information Services
    World Wide Web Services
      Application Developement Features
        ...
        CGI
        ISAPI Extensions

Then change the authentication of the website to a user that can access the website directory.

  I recommend not using pass through authentication unless you know how to give permissions to
all the different parts of IIS that need access to your website directory. I couldn't figure it
out for both ISAPI and CGI so I just used my administrator account. Using the administrator
account is probably also a bad idea, you should probably make a new user just for your website
and limit which folders this user can access to just the website folder.

To change the authentication of the website, go to:
  Start -> Windows Administrative Tools -> Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager
  Under connections on the left, expand the hierarchical list so that
  Computer -> Sites -> Default Web Site is visible and left click on the Default Web Site to
   hilight it.
  Then under Actions on the right, choose Basic Settings.
  In the Edit Site pop up, choose Connect As, then select specific user and choose Set...
  In the Set Credentials pop up, put in the user name and password of a user on your computer 
  that can access the default website directory. For security reasons, it's probably a bad 
  idea to use an administrator account, but you could make a new user, and give the new user 
  access to the directory.
  (I didn't test the new user case...)
  Click on Test Settings. Both Authentication and Authorization should be green with a checkmark.
   If not, things aren't going to work.

Next, build diaperglu if you need to, then copy diaperglu.exe and/or libdiaperglu.dll to the 
  website directory. 
  You only need to copy one of these. But you can do both if you want. 
  You'll need to use different file name extensions for each mode if you do both.
  diaperglu.exe is for cgi mode and libdiaperglu.dll is for isapi mode.

Next you will need to add a folder (subdirectory) to the default website. I tried to get things 
  work in the default web site folder, but due to permissions issues, I think you have to make 
  a virtual directory so that you can give permissions to a user account. Also, when I tried to 
  assign a virtual directory to the default website directory, it broke IIS and I had reinstall
  IIS.

To do this:
 open file explorer,
 browse to your default website directory,  (on my computer it's C:\inetpub\wwwroot\)
 right click on the directory and choose Folder
 in the text edit box for the folder, enter your folder name. For this example I'm using
   myphysicaldirectory.

Next copy diaperglu.exe and/or libdiaperglu.dll to your new website directory.

Next copy a script file to the website directory. 
  You can use helloworld.dglu and or helloworld.asdglu
  in the samplescript/CGIScripts/ subdirectory. If you are installing both diaperglu.exe 
  and libdiaperglu.dll you will need to use different file name extensions for cgi and 
  isapi mode. 
  For example, .dglu can be for diaperglu.exe and .asdglu can be for libdiaperglu.dll.
  If you want to make your own file, it needs to be an html file including the response 
    header. This looks like:

    ." Content-type: text/html" CRLF
    CRLF
    ." &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;" CRLF
    ." Hello World on CGI!" CRLF
    ." &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;" CRLF

Next, make sure the user you chose as the user for the website has access to the web site 
  directory and the files. 
  In file explorer, right click on the directory each file and choose properties. 
  Then select the security tab. 
  If your user falls into one of the categories listed, you are ok. 
  For instance, if your user is an administrator and administrators are listed, 
    then you are ok.
  If not, you will need to add the user to the list. 

Next you need to make a virtual directory for your physical website directory.

To do this, go to:
Start -> Windows Administrative Tools -> Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager
Under connections on the left, expand the hierarchical list so that
  Computer -> Sites -> Default Web Site is visible and left click on the Default Web Site
    to hilight it.
  Right click on the Default Web Site and choose Add Virtual Directory...
  In the pop up:
    for Alias: choose your virtual directory name. I'm using myvirtualdirectory for 
      this example.
    for Physical Path: choose your websites physical directory. For this example it's
      C:\inetpub\wwwroot\myphysicaldirectory
    click Connect as... to get the Connect As pop up
      choose Specific User:
      click Set... to get the set Credentials pop up
        use the same user name and password that you chose for the Default Web Site
        basic settings
    click Test Settings... Both Authentication and Authorization should be green with 
      a checkmark. If not, things aren't going to work.

Now you need to associate your script file name extensions with the script engine. 
  For this example I'm going to associate .dglu with diaperglu.exe and .asdglu with 
  libdiaperglu.dll

To do CGI do this, go to:
  Start -> Windows Administrative Tools -> Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager
  Under connections on the left, expand the hierarchical list so that
    Computer -> Sites -> Default Web Site is visible and left click on the Default Web 
    Site to hilight it.
  The box in the middle should say something like Default Web Site Home
  Double click Handler Mappings
  Under actions on the right, choose Add Script Map
  In the Add Script Map dialog do this:
    for Request path: *.dglu
    for Executable: browse to C:\inetpub\wwwroot\myphysicaldirectory\diaperglu.exe 
      and choose it
    for Name: put whatever you want, just not the same name as something else. 
      I used dotdglucgi3

  A pop up will ask you if you want to allow this cgi extension, 
    If you do, say yes.

  Left click on your computer name under Connections on the left
  In the box on the right under Manage Server choose restart

You should now be able to open a browser and run the script file.

To do this, open a brower and enter this URL:
  http://localhost/myvirtualdirectory/helloworld.dglu

If it worked, you should see "Hello World on CGI!"


To do ISAPI do this, go to:
  Start -> Windows Administrative Tools -> Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager
  Under connections on the left, expand the hierarchical list so that
    Computer -> Sites -> Default Web Site is visible and left click on the Default Web Site to 
    hilight it.
  The box in the middle should say something like Default Web Site Home
  Double click Handler Mappings
  Under actions on the right, choose Add Script Map
  In the Add Script Map dialog do this:
    for Request path: *.asdglu
    for Executable: browse to C:\inetpub\wwwroot\myphysicaldirectory\libdiaperglu.dll 
    and choose it
    for Name: put whatever you want, just not the same name as something else. 
    I used dotasdgluisapi3

  A pop up will ask you if you want to allow this isapi extension, If you do, say yes.

  Left click on your computer name under Connections on the left
  In the box on the right under Manage Server choose restart

You should now be able to open a browser and run the script file.

To do this, open a brower and enter this URL:
  http://localhost/myvirtualdirectory/helloworld.asdglu

If it worked, you should see "Hello World on ISAPI!"


If you want to support the diaperglu.exe?myscriptfilename.dglu run mode, do this:
  Start -> Windows Administrative Tools -> Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager
  Under connections on the left, expand the hierarchical list so that
    Computer -> Sites -> Default Web Site is visible and left click on the Default 
    Web Site to hilight it.
  The box in the middle should say something like Default Web Site Home
  Double click Handler Mappings
  The top of the middle section should say Handler Mappings
  Left click on the *.dglu CgiModule entry to highlight it.
  On the right under Actions choose Edit Feature Permissions.
  In the pop up, make sure Execute has a check.

  Left click on your computer name under Connections on the left
  In the box on the right under Manage Server choose restart

You should now be able to open a browser and run diaperglu to get the no script found page.
  http://localhost/myvirtualdirectory/diaperglu.exe

You should also be able to use diaperglu to run script files this way.... on Windows you need
 to have the physical path relative to the web site root to the script file after the ?
 http://localhost/myvirtualdirectory/diaperglu.exe?myphysicaldirectory/helloworld.dglu

If you want to support the libdiaperglu.dll?myscriptfilename run mode, in addition to enabling
  execute for the handler mapping, you also have to give user anonymous access to the physical
  website folder. Do this:
  Start -> Windows Administrative Tools -> Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager
  Under connections on the left, expand the hierarchical list so that
    Computer -> Sites -> Default Web Site is visible and left click on the Default Web Site to 
    hilight it.
  The box in the middle should say something like Default Web Site Home
  Double click Handler Mappings
  The top of the middle section should say Handler Mappings
  Left click on the *.asdglu IsapiModule entry to highlight it.
  On the right under Actions choose Edit Feature Permissions.
  In the pop up, make sure Execute has a check.

  Left click on your computer name under Connections on the left
  In the box on the right under Manage Server choose restart

  Open file explore and browse to your website's physical folder.
  Right click on your website's physical folder and choose properties.
  On the properties pop up, go to the security tab and choose Advanced.
  On the Advanced pop up, choose Change Permissions
  After the popup changes, choose Add
  On the permission pop up choose Select a principal
  On the Select User or Group pop up, type anonymous in the box and choose Check Names
  The name should change to ANONYMOUS_LOGON or something like that. Choose ok.

  I would restart IIS just in case.
  
You should now be able to open a browser and run libdiaperglu to get the no script found page.
  http://localhost/myvirtualdirectory/libdiaperglu.dll

You should also be able to use libdiaperglu to run script files this way.... on Windows you need
 to have the physical path relative to the web site root to the script file after the ?
 http://localhost/myvirtualdirectory/libdiaperglu.dll?myphysicaldirectory/helloworld.asdglu

        <h3>File Upload</h3>

        <p>HTML form file upload is supported for cgi;
however, I have not yet written a script to make it convenient
for you. When your script gets control, the header is already
loaded into the post buffer. The file may or may not still be
loading. To determine this you have to do a blocking read from
stdin until the os returns 0 characters. This means your script
may be at the mercy of the OS and could hang if the OS never
returns. This will wait for all characters and append them to
what is already loaded in the post buffer:</p>

<p class=command><pre>
HEX
: readstdin ( -- )
   BEGIN
     GETHSTDIN 1000 70000000 POSTBUFFERID WAITREADN&gt;BUF 
   0= UNTIL  
;
</pre></p>

<p>You will need to get the boundary marker
from the 'CONTENT-TYPE' environment variable and parse the post
buffer data yourself.</p>

      </div>
      
      
      <div class=pagestuffsection id=runmodes>
      
        <h3>Different Ways to Run Diaperglu</h3>
        
        <p>You can put the Diaperglu in your cgi-bin directory and use it to run script files
directly. I added this for those cases where your ISP does not
allow you to associate a file extension with a script engine. If
you do this, the script engine supports the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>http://www.yourwebsite.com/cgi-bin/diaperglu</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you browse to just the script engine, it
will try to execute the script 'noscript.dglu'. If it can not
find that file, it will show a default page letting you know no
script file was specified.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>http://www.yourwebsite.com/cgi-bin/diaperglu?scriptfilename.dglu</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you browse to the script engine and pass
in a filename as a parameter, it will try to execute the script
with that filename. If it can not find that script or you do not have permissions
it will show a default page letting you know it
could not find the script file.</p>

<p>In this mode, only the first parameter's value is used as the script file name.
This allows you to pass other parameters in to Diaperglu, and even do something like this:<p>

<blockquote>
  <p>http://www.yourwebsite.com/cgi-bin/diaperglu?MYSCRIPT=scriptfilename.dglu&amp;MYPARAMETER=awesome</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under Apache and diaperglu?scriptfilename.dglu in CGI mode, Diaperglu also tries to build the full path for you,
but takes the path information from SCRIPT_FILENAME. This means scriptfilename.dglu's path has to be relative to
the directory containing Diaperglu. You may run into some security issues on Catalina if you try to put the
script files in a directory different from Diaperglu...</p>
