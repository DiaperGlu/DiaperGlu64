Welcome to DiaperGlu64

DiaperGlu is a 64 bit Forth script engine that runs under Mac Os and Windows.


The documentation root is in /DiaperGlu64/docs/index.htm


After opening index.htm, clicking on the Building tab will take you to the instructions
  for building and running DiaperGlu

The DHTML scripting tab page has instructions for running DiaperGlu as a CGI script engine
  under IIS and Apache.

The Using DiaperGlu tab page has a few walk throughs on using the various features of DiaperGlu.
  I recommend at least reading the part on using buffers since it explains how the life
  of pointers into growable buffers is limited in DiaperGlu.

The Documentation Key tab page has an explanation of the shorthand used to document 
  parameter passing.

The Script Command Reference tab page has links to most of the DiaperGlu Forth words. On the 
  left is an index of each group of words, including the x86 asembler words.

The C Library API Reference tab page has links to most of the C functions exported in the 
  DiaperGlu64 shared library.

The Handy References tab page quick reference sheets for using CSS and MySQL.

The About tab page has the Forth Standard summary of the DiaperGlu Forth system.

The License tab page has a copy of the GNU General Public License Version 2 which is the
  license DiaperGlu is released under.

The Contact tab page has my email.

The Forth Draft Standard page has a copy of 1994 Forth Draft Standard.


I wasn't as careful with the documentation as I was with the code. I keep finding errors
  in the documentation like stuff that didn't get updated when DiaperGlu switched from 
  32 bits to 64 bits, or copy and paste errors. So some stuff may not work exactly as
  the documentation says.
